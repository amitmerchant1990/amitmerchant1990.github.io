The sourcecode of [amitmerchant.com](https://www.amitmerchant.com)
==========================

This is the codebase of my [personal blog](https://www.amitmerchant.com). It's built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and using a theme called [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie). I'll try to update it every now and then.

Suggestions are welcomed!
