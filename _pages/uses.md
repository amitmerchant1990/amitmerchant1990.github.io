## Hardware

![](/images/setup-2108.jpg)

I'm mostly a laptop person. I've a 15" HP Notebook which is running on Intel Core i5. It has 8GB of RAM and 1TB of SATA hard drive. I've dual-boot this machine to run [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) and [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) so that I can use former for all my programming needs and for all other purposes such as graphics design, video editing and so on, use the latter. The battery of this laptop is currently dead so I'm tethered to the wall all of the time nowadays. 

I've a ~~[Intex optical mouse](https://www.amazon.in/Intex-Magic-USB-Optical-Mouse/dp/B01GV3M40S)~~ [HP X3500 Wireless Mouse](https://store.hp.com/in-en/default/hp-x3500-wireless-mouse-h4k65aa.html) which I use when I need to do designing stuff. 

As for the keyboard, currently, I'm using a mechanical keyboard called [Zebronics Max Plus](https://zebronics.com/products/max-plus).

I also have a [Transcend's StoreJet 1TB external hard drive](https://www.amazon.in/Transcend-StoreJet-2-5-inch-Portable-External/dp/B005MNGQ6C) where I store my backups and all my multimedia holdings. 

My phone's a ~~[Xiaomi Mi A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Mi_A1)~~ [Pixel 4a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a). The reason why it's my daily driver is that I'm a stock android enthusiast and ofcourse, it's coming from the God of Android itself.

To listen to the music I've a pair of [Audio-Technica ATH-CLR100](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/a0a8895f03d70c11/index.html), a [Boat Rockerz 400](https://www.boat-lifestyle.com/products/rockerz-400) On-Ear headphones, and a three-year-old Philip's Bluetooth speaker.

Apart from this, I own ~~two~~ three watches of which one is a fitness tracker called [Mi Band 2](https://www.mi.com/global/miband2/) which I'm using to track my run and calories, a classic [Casio F-91W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W), and a [Casio Royale](https://www.casio.com/products/watches/classic/ae1200wh-1a).

## Software

As I mentioned earlier, I work with Linux to fulfill all my programming related stuff. And the Linux flavour I'm right now using is [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/).

I mostly work with PHP, JavaScript, and occasionally Java. I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to version control all my opensource and personal projects and manage all those on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990). 

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my browser of choice. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my primary editor mainly because it's more modern, highly configurable, and lightweight in comparison to other Electron-based editors such as [Atom](https://atom.io/). Apart from this, it has a repository of great plugins. VS Code is great but when I need some more control I use IDE such as [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

I'm using [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) fonts across all my text editors and IDEs. These looks great overall and supports [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthographic_ligature) which is nice!

I love everything dark. Editor themes are no exception. Both my editor and IDE is rocking [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/). It's a great dark theme and gives me a consistent environment across my devices and setups.

I use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to perform API calls.

I'm sucked into Google's ecosystem of software. I store all my photos on [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) and occasionally edit them on [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_IN).

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) is the browser of my choice.

I use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) to store my documents and backups. 

I use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) to get in sync with my todo lists and important notes. 

I use [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) to sync my files and clipboard across my Android phone and Ubuntu desktop. 

To make vector graphics, I use [Vectr](https://vectr.com/).

When I need to compress images, I use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). It uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG files.

I take a lot of screenshots. For this purpose, I use [Flameshot](https://flameshot.js.org/) as my primary screenshot tool and [Zoho Annotator](https://www.zoho.com/annotator/) to take take screenshots while I'm on Chrome.

I occasionally record [screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmitMerchant). For that purpose, I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

I read a lot of eBooks. I use [Foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/) to read eBooks on my Ubuntu machine and [Google Play Books](https://play.google.com/books) to read on my mobile phone.

## The Blog's Stack

As for this blog, it is currently being setup on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The Jekyll theme that I'm using is called [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) which is a tailor-made according to my taste.

The [search](/search/) in here is powered by [this little JavaScript library](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search) which is perfect for a static site built using Jekyll.

For all my Markdown writing needs, I use an editor called [Markdownify](https://markdownify.js.org/) which I made two years ago. And for fixing grammar and typos, I use [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com/).

I use [Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/) by Adobe to create image banners for my articles.

I'm an avid reader so I've kept a list of RSS feeds of my favorite blogs in [Feeder](https://feeder.co).

## In closing
