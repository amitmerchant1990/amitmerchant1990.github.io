<h2 style="text-align: left;">Allo! Allo! Thank you for stopping by here. I'm Amit, a software engineer and tech blogger from India.</h2>

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [Sarvajanik College Of Engineering & Technology, Surat](http://scet.ac.in) (Computer Science and Engineering, 2011).

I love exploring new technologies and playing around with them. I first wrote code in third grade of school in a language called [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). I have started my professional web development journey building web apps using PHP and JavaScript. I have leveraged variety of MVC frameworks, the likes of [Laravel](http://laravel.com) to build dynamic web apps. In recent times, my interest shift towards JavaScript and more specifically towards server-side JavaScript. So, I've started to try my hands-on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Currently, I'm hacking into ~~[Electron](http://electron.atom.io)~~ [React](https://reactjs.org/).

I'm currently working at [Codal](http://codal.com/). In my spare time, I love to contribute to the open source community by creating helpful [tools](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990), doing [photography & sketching](https://www.instagram.com/amit_merchant/), listening to some music which ranges from rock to sufi, going around with my beautiful wife and friends.

This blog is a place to brain-dump things which I learn on a daily basis. It has been setup using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I'm using [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) jekyll theme which I've heavily personalized to suit my need and taste.

You can contact me at **bullredeyes@gmail.com** if you want to discuss something with me or just want to say "Hi!". For any sort of business inquiries or advertisement opportunities, you can navigate to [this page](/contact) for more details.

_Hasta la vista!_
