Today's the day when I'm finally going to write about the current setup of things that I used to get my work done. This will include what software, hardware, accessories I'm using on daily basis at home/work. 

## Hardware

![](/images/setup-2108.jpg)

I'm mostly a laptop person. I've a 15" HP Notebook which is running on Intel Core i5. It has 8GB of RAM and 1TB of SATA hard drive. I've dualboot this machine to run [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) and [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10) so that I can use former for all my programming needs and for all other purposes such as graphics design, video editing and so on, use the latter. The battery of this laptop is currently dead so I'm tethered to wall all of the time nowadays. 

I've a [Intex optical mouse](https://www.amazon.in/Intex-Magic-USB-Optical-Mouse/dp/B01GV3M40S) which I use when I need to do designing stuff. I don't have any external keyboard right now cause I feel laptop's keyboard is sufficient for my purposes. 

I also have a [Transcend's StoreJet 1TB external hard drive](https://www.amazon.in/Transcend-StoreJet-2-5-inch-Portable-External/dp/B005MNGQ6C) where I store my backups and all my multimedia holdings. 

My phone's a [Xiaomi Mi A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Mi_A1). The reason why it's my daily driver is becasue I'm a stock android enthusiast and this is an Android One phone so I'll be on newest and greatest of Android for atleast 2 years.

To listen to the music I've a pair of [Audio-Technica ATH-CLR100](https://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/a0a8895f03d70c11/index.html) and a three year old Philip's bluetooth speaker.

Apart from this, I own two watches of which one is a fitness tracker called [Mi Band 2](https://www.mi.com/global/miband2/) which I'm using to track my run and calories and the other one is the classic [Casio F-91W](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W).

## Software

As I mentioned earlier, I work with Linux to fulfil all my programming related stuff. I mostly work with PHP, JavaScript and ocassionally Java. I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to version control all my opensource and personal projects and manage all those on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990). 

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is my browser of choice. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my primary editor mainly because it's more modern ,highly configurable and light in comparison to other Electron based editors. Apart from this, it has a repository of great plugins. VS Code is great but when I need some more control I use IDE such as [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

I love everything dark. Editor themes are no exception. Both my editor and IDE is rocking [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/). It's a great dark theme and gives me consistent environment across my setup.

I use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to perform API calls.

I'm totally suck into Google's ecosystem of software. So, I store all my photos on [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) and occasionally edit them on [Snapseed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed&hl=en_IN). I use [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) to store my documents. I use [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) to get in sync with my todo lists. To make vector graphics, I use [Vectr](https://vectr.com/).

My current blog is setup on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/amitmerchant1990.github.io). I write all my writings in an editor called [Markdownify](https://markdownify.js.org/) which I made two years ago.

## Conclusion

So, that's about it. These are all the things which I use on day-to-day basis at my work/home to get the things done. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Let me know in the comments below if you want to know anything which might have missed in the article.
