I fell in love with you the moment I discovered you. I still remember, you and I were still in our teens at that time. Whenever I searched you, you served me unconditionally. And even though we weren't matured enough, our love still grown.. gradually. Call it "Love at first site" or "Love over time", it will remain between us for an eternity.. 

The cliché "what you are seeking is seeking you" perfectly describes our relationship.

And lastly, no matter if you're a year older than me, I'll still be your devotional lover, forever.

Happy 30th birthday dear web! ♥️ 

Let's grow together for an another decade, an another lifetime.

Yours truly.
