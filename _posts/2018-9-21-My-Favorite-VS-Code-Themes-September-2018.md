VS Code is no doubt the favorite code editor of developers these days. Colour themes let you modify the colours in Visual Studio Code's user interface to suit your preferences and work environment. Today, I'm going to show you my favorite themes which I've tried out so far and compiled down the best among them. 

## [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda)

This partiuclar theme is one hell of a gem. If you're a sucker of dark themes, I'm sure you'll love this one. A very subtle amount of colors, easy on eyes and supporting most languages. Definitely, check it out.

## [Night Rider](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kyleerickson.night-rider)

An electrifying, vibrant color theme. It's a gorgeous theme which has a shade of purple as a background. I love the colors which they've chosen for fonts. Matches perfectly with the kind of purple-ish feel they've given to it.

## [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula)

Every dark theme list is incomplete without mentioning Darcula theme. Enough said! It's THE best dark theme out there. Period. The fact that this theme is available not only for VS Code but for [other editors](https://draculatheme.com) as well makes it a goto theme for dark theme enthusiats for their streamlined workflows.

## [Darcula At Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bceskavich.theme-dracula-at-night)

A slight variation to the official Darcula theme. This theme is for all those who've always wanted high-contrast version of the Dracula theme. So, here you got it. It has all the goodies of the Dracula theme except it's more high-contrast in nature.

## [Calamity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Pustur.calamity-vscode)

Calamity is a purple dark theme with medium to high contrast. I love how this theme gives an overall rusty kind of look to the editor while keeping it easy on eyes.

## [Mirage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tristanremy.mirage)

Mirage is a blue theme with pastel tones with shades of purple.
