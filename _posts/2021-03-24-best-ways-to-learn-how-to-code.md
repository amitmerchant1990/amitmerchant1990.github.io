## Choose a language you want to learn

It is very essential to select the right programming language once you enter the world of programming. 

As every project has a requirement of a certain set of skills. For instance, to make an Android application, you have to know Java and for iOS, you should have skills in Swift. In case you are not sure which programming language is used for what, I've listed below the four most popular programming languages. 

Here are some of the popular programming languages:

- **Java**: The most dominating language, without which it’s hard to create mobile applications or fulfill back-end web development. Java resembles English as it’s relatively easy-to-learn. Also, with the demand for Java increasing significantly the vacancies for newbies in organizations have increased.  
- **Python**: The second most valuable language that has a great number of use cases. Recently, it’s mostly been used in data analysis projects. 
- **PHP**: The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is mainly used for developing web based software applications.
- **Ruby**: Do you dream to become a web developer? If so, then Ruby is an excellent choice for you. It is gaining popularity and is important for smooth coordination of all the elements that are working in the background of the newly launched website. 
- **HTML**: Ideal for individuals who are just about to start as HTML is simple to understand. It is used in front-end web development.

## Write your own programs

After completing some online courses and gaining sufficient knowledge, it is time to bring the information you have learned into the real world. Start creating programs that you need in your everyday life. 

So wisely choose the project that interests you the most and that can be created using the language that you have just learned. It’s significant to find a project which you like because the only way to stay motivated is doing what you really enjoy. It’s better if you start with mini-projects for beginners and proceed to the more advanced ones. 

If you are learning Java then you can go for developing a currency converter, simple banking application, or ATM interface. In case you are mastering Python, try to create a text-based adventure game or a Tic-Tac-Toe game. For HTML learners, I'd suggest creating your own portfolio page or if you want to develop something more interesting then try to code the restaurant website.

All those project ideas will perfect showcases to present to your future employee.  

## Wrap up

The emergence of online learning platforms has made it easy to learn any programming language from any part of the globe. You can enroll in your favorite course or understand the fundamentals of coding by watching some of the popular programming YouTube channels. 

After completing the theoretical part make sure you bring acquired knowledge into everyday life. Start with creating the most basic Android app or by developing a website and gradually move to complex tasks. The practice is the basic key to become a prosperous programmer one day.
