When Laravel 8 released, It came with a lot of new features & improvements but along with it, the Laravel team has also introduced [Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/introduction.html) for application scaffolding which comes with all the bells and whistles in-built such as login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via Laravel Sanctum, and optional team management.

It's kinds of sweet that the framework itself provides all these features out-of-the-box. But here's the thing. Many developers didn't like this at all and criticized the Laravel team a lot for it. People didn't like it because, under the hood, Jetstream enforced the use of [Livewire](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/inertia.html) for scaffolding and many developers didn't like this. Why? Because people didn't want to learn a new framework/stack just to try out Laravel 8.

There was a growing need to have something really simple that just works. Laravel team responded to all the hate and criticism and then hence Laravel Breeze came into existence!

## So, What is Breeze?

[Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) is the official package from the Laravel team that can be used to create a minimal and simple scaffolding with authentication, just like it was used to be in Pre Laravel 8 era. There's no enforcement to use Livewire, Inertia, or anything else.

Laravel Breeze is powered by Blade and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). It publishes authentication controllers and views to your application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs. So, no hair-pulling in tracking those in [Fortify](https://github.com/laravel/fortify) and other unknown places.

## Installing Breeze

Installing Breeze in your fresh Laravel application is as easy as installing a new Composer dependency.

First, create a new Laravel app.

```bash
$ laravel new my-app

$ cd my-app
```

Then require Breeze as development dependency and install the scaffolding like so.

```bash
$ composer require laravel/breeze --dev

$ php artisan breeze:install
```

On the successful installation, your terminal would look like the following.

As you can tell from the screenshot, the next step is to run `npm install && npm run dev` to build assets of your Laravel application.

Once done, you can migrate the database by running `php artisan migrate` which will create necessary tables for authentication such as `users`, `password_resets`, and so on in the application's database.

Also, you can find all the controllers created during scaffolding under `app/Http/Controllers/Auth` for further customizations which is, of course, the USP of Breeze. ðŸ˜‰

And that's about it! The Breeze should be installed in your Laravel application successfully now.

## Running Breeze Application

You can now run the application by running `php artisan serve` and you can access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) which should look like this.
