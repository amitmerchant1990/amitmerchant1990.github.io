This are some set of things that I use on daily basis. The page is inspired from [The Setup](https://usesthis.com).

# What hardware do you use?

I'm using [HP Notebook 15-AC646tx (V5D74PA)](http://www.amazon.in/HP-Notebook-15-AC646tx-i5-4210U-Processor-8GB-1TB/dp/B01FAVHX4Y?tag=googinhydr18418-21&tag=googinkenshoo-21&ascsubtag=0adbb1a1-92ec-47dd-aba3-0871c28d3c77) which is rocking Intel Core i5 coupled with 8GB of RAM. It also has AMD Radeon R5 M330 Graphics card installed in it. This is my primary machine and the fastest that I ever have.

I've [ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE550KL)
](https://www.asus.com/in/Phone/ZenFone-2-Laser-ZE550KL/) as my daily driver. It's good for my photography needs and moderate usage but I'd like to have a phone having a stock Android.

For my music related needs, I've got [Audio Technica ATH-CLR100](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/a0a8895f03d70c11/index.html) Wired Headphones and [Philips SBT 30 Portable Bluetooth Speaker](http://www.philips.co.in/c-p/SBT30_00/soundshooter-wireless-portable-speaker) which are nice when I want to indulge into some of my favorite music.
