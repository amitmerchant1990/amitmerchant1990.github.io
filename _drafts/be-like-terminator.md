A few days ago I was (re-)watching, probably the finest movies from Hollywood, Terminator 2: Judgement Day. It's one of my favorite movies and I don't loose a chance to watch it everytime it comes on the TV. 

Turns out, everytime I watch this movie, I left with a different perpective about it altogether. But today, I'm going to talk about specifically about the Terminator (upon which the entire movie is based on). I've sorted out some of the traits of a Terminator and I'll discuss how we can draw some lessons from those machines in order to make our live a little better if we apply those to ourselves.

## Focused

The terminator is an Android and it works based on the commands that have been assigned to it. In this specific movie, there are two terminators. One which tries to save the protagonist, John Conell and the other one which tries to kill him.

They are doing so because they are assigned with the commands to pull out the respective tasks and you can see in the movie that how far they go in order to achieve so. They are so focused in accomplishing their task that don't even mind killing people if that can help achieve the end result. 

We can't get to the level of focus these terminators possess but if we can hold of even 30-40% of it, our life would be changed dramatically

## Result Oriented

Because terminator are focused to their end goals, it also makes them result oriented in the process. As the name suggests a "Terminator" would try to gets itself terminated if its end goal is met.

They would beat the hell out of their opponent irrespective of the fact that their goal is achieved or not and try to get to the goal as close as possible.

For instance, in order to get to know where John Conner right now is, T1000 mutates himself to John's step mom and tries to invite him for the dinner so that he would kill him. It's an another story that he failed to do so. But morale of story is for him, nothing else is more important than killing John Conner and he would go beyond his limits to do so.  I really liked his devotion towards making that happen.

## Observant

Terminators are highly observant about their surroundings. They observe things around them and pick only those from which they get benefitted. 

For instance, the [Model 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)), when arrives on the Earth from the future, he was almost naked. He would need cloths. Of course! So, he goes to the nearby bar, scans people and try to match size of the cloth which matches with his physique. 

Today, people are not so much observant. They stick to their screens so much that they quickly forgets, there's a damn living world around them to interact and talk to. Terminators are great at this skill, I guess.

## Quick learner

As a machine terminators are quick learners, naturally. For instance, at one point in the movie, Model 101 would talk in its usual "robotic" way. So, John try teaching him a few words in such sentences which would make him sound natural. The terminator leanrs this as a polite student and applies it later in the movie for a similar kind of a dialog. 

He also learns mannerism of humans really quickly. I wish I would be like him, a quick learner, my life would've been a lot smoother.
