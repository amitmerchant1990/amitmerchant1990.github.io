Allo! Allo! Thank you for stopping by here. I'm Amit, a software engineer residing in Gujarat, India, with focus on creating apps for web as well as mobile devices.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [Sarvajanik College Of Engineering & Technology, Surat](http://scet.ac.in) (Computer Science and Engineering, 2011).

I love exploring new technologies and playing around with them. I have started my web development journey building web apps using PHP and JavaScript. I have used variety of MVC frameworks likes of [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) to build dynamic web apps. In recent times, my interest shift towards JavaScript and more specifically towards server-side JavaScript. So, I've started to try my hands-on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Apart from Node.js, I'm also hacking into [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

I'm currently working at [Maven Agency](http://www.mavenagency.co.za). In my spare time, I love to contribute to the open source community by creating [tools](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990) which can be helpful to others, doing [photography & sketching](https://www.instagram.com/amit_merchant/) in my spare time, listening to some music which ranges from rock to sufi, going around with my beautiful wife and friends.
