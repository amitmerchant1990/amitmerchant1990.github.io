Allo! Allo! Thank you for stopping by here. I'm Amit, a software engineer residing in Surat, Gujarat, India, with a focus on creating apps for web as well as mobile devices.

I obtained my undergraduate degree from the [Sarvajanik College Of Engineering & Technology, Surat](http://scet.ac.in) (Computer Science and Engineering, 2011).

I love exploring new technologies and playing around with them. I first wrote code in third standard in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). I have started my professional web development journey building web apps using PHP and JavaScript. I have leveraged variety of MVC frameworks likes of [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) to build dynamic web apps. In recent times, my interest shift towards JavaScript and more specifically towards server-side JavaScript. So, I've started to try my hands-on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). Apart from Node.js, I'm also hacking into ~~[Electron](http://electron.atom.io)~~ [React](https://reactjs.org/).

I'm currently working at [UNOApp](http://www.unoapp.com). In my spare time, I love to contribute to the open source community by creating [tools](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990) which can be helpful to others, doing [photography & sketching](https://www.instagram.com/amit_merchant/) in my spare time, listening to some music which ranges from rock to sufi, going around with my beautiful wife and friends.

This blog has been setup using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I have used [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to quickly set it up on GitHub Pages without setting up a local environment. You can find the code of the same over [here](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/amitmerchant1990.github.io).
